Using Machine Learning to Analyze Social Media Addiction and Student Outcomes
Project Overview

This project analyzes a real-world survey dataset to explore patterns in social media addiction among students and examine how addiction relates to mental health, sleep, relationship conflicts, and academic performance. We use exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques to gain insights and build predictive models.

Research Questions
How do social media addiction mean scores vary across different countries?
Can social media addiction scores predict relationship conflicts?
Can we predict a student’s level of social media addiction based on mental health and sleep duration?
How does social media addiction correlate with academic performance?
Dataset

We use the Social Media Addiction vs. Relationships dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships
The dataset contains approximately 700 student survey responses with variables such as:
Addicted_Score
Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours
Mental_Health_Score
Sleep_Hours_Per_Night
Conflicts_Over_Social_Media
Affects_Academic_Performance
Country

Methods
Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
Exploratory data analysis with matplotlib and seaborn
Classification models (logistic regression, tree-based models)
Regression models (linear regression, random forest regressor)
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, R², and mean absolute error
